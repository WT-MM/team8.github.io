    what: |
        Next weekend, 60 high school robotics teams from around the world will power up to compete in an epic robotics tournament in the heart of Silicon Valley! The <a href="http://www.firstsv.org/">Silicon Valley Regional</a> (SVR) is an official <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> (FRC) event. This season, they will be bringing robots built to play the 2018 game FIRST Power Up. 
        </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Learn about the objectives of the game FIRST Power Up by watching the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZbdwYiCY74">game animation</a>. The reveal video for our team’s 2018 robot can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMsz67L5o6M">here</a>.
        </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paly Robotics will be hosting tours of the Silicon Valley Regional to introduce parents, students, and sponsors to FRC. Attendees will enjoy a true “FIRST Experience”: walking through the hectic pits where robot repairs are being made, code is being written, and game strategies are being developed, watching riveting matches with two alliances of three robots going head to head from the stands, and meeting the high school students, mentors and volunteers that make it all possible.
        </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tours are completely free, but lunch and transportation to the venue are not provided. After registering, a confirmation email will be sent out with more detailed information on the tours and meeting location. We looking forward to seeing you there!
