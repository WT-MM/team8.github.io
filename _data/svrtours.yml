    what: |
        Next weekend, 60 high school robotics teams from around the world will descend into the heart of Silicon Valley to compete in an epic robotics tournament! The <a href="http://www.firstsv.org/">Silicon Valley Regional</a> (SVR) is an official <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">FIRST Robotics Competition</a> (FRC) event with teams playing the 2017 game FIRST Steamworks.
        </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can learn about FIRST Steamworks by watching this year's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI">game animation</a> and you can also watch Paly Robotics' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hg4vbH9MG4k">robot reveal video</a>.
        </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Paly Robotics will be hosting tours of the Silicon Valley Regional to introduce parents, students, and sponsors to FRC. Attendees will enjoy a true “FIRST Experience”: walking through the hectic pits where robot repairs are being made, watching riveting robot matches from the grandstands, and meeting the high school students, mentors and volunteers that make it all possible.
        </br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tours are completely free, but lunch and transportation to the venue are not provided. After registering, a confirmation email will be sent out with more detailed information on the tours and meeting location. We looking forward to seeing you there!
