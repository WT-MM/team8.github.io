    AboutTheCamp1:
        paragraph1: This year, Paly Robotics will be offering two different weeks of our annual summer camp for incoming middle school students (incoming 6th - 9th). We hope to spark interest and start future high school students on a path in science, technology, engineering, art or math (STEAM). If you have any questions, feel free to contact us at <a class="paragraph-links" href="mailto:summercamp@palyrobotics.com">summercamp@palyrobotics.com</a>.

            title2: More than Robotics
            paragraph2: When most people think about robotics, they picture machines that are controlled by computers to complete certain tasks. While building and programming robots is a big part of what we do, our team is much more than that below the surface. We have different sections of the team that focus on things such as art, public relations, and student leadership, to name a few. Through the different sessions offered, campers will be able to experience what makes our team more than just robotics. To learn more about the sessions offered, check out the Sessions page.

            title2: Counselors
            paragraph2: Student mentoring is a big part of our team’s philosophy, and we rely on passing down knowledge from the older students to the younger students. Reflecting this philosophy, our high school team members will be teaching campers about STEAM through the different aspects of the robotics team. Just as we were taught by older team members, we hope to be able to teach what we have learned to the younger generation.

            paragraph: We are currently waitlisting campers for sessions that are full.  If you would like to waitlist your child for a session, please select that session during registration.

            title: Robot Design and Hardware
            img: /assets/img/summercamp/build-img.png
            info: In the Robot Design and Hardware camp, campers will experience the build season of a FRC robot, where teams create a robot to compete in a timed game filled with challenges. During the camp, campers will experience the usage of power tools, specialized machines, and CAD software to design and manufacture their robot, culminating in a FRC-style mini-game at the end of the week. However, most importantly, they will have the experience of innovation, problem solving, and working as a team, the more important things to succeed in the 21st century.

            title: Programming
            img: /assets/img/summercamp/programming-img.png
            info: The programming camp will further campers' computer science skills through projects and activities using Python 3, incorporating control flow and other computer science principles. Campers will leave the camp with an expanded knowledge of computer science and increased programming proficiency. In addition, they will gain experience with the industry standard for version control, git, as they collaborate on projects with other campers. All skill levels will be accommodated.

            title: Entrepreneurship and Website Design
            img: /assets/img/summercamp/business-img.jpg
            info: In the Entrepreneurship and Web Design session, campers will develop their own potential startup companies, and the marketing and advertising skills necessary to get their companies off the ground. Using languages such as HTML and CSS, students will create a website showcasing their proposals while gaining valuable coding and website management skills, as well as GitHub to keep track of changes in a group environment.

            title: Animation and Graphic Design
            img: /assets/img/summercamp/art-img.png
            info: Using industry standard software such as Autodesk Maya, learn how to make 3D models and then bring them to life using animation. Explore the basics of graphic design with Adobe Illustrator, and practice your design skills. Learn about typography and how to balance compositions while getting a taste of what it’s like to design for a client. At the end of the week, students will be able to take home their very own animated short, a 3D computer modelled set of their own design, a poster, their very own personally designed pins, and whatever else they may have created.

            question: Is previous experience required?
            answer: Not at all. We hope to introduce all campers to STEAM regardless of what they already know. If they have previous experience, that is totally fine, and we will be sure to keep them engaged with interesting activities.
