    AboutTheCamp2:
        title2: More than Robots
        paragraph2: When most people think about robotics, they picture computer-controlled machines that are coded to complete certain tasks. While building and programming robots are a big part of what we do, our team provides many more opportunities outside of traditional technical fields. We have different subteams and groups that focus on other non-technical aspects, including art, public relations, and student leadership, to name a few. Through the different sessions offered, campers will be able to experience what makes our team more than just robotics. To learn more about the various sessions, check out the Sessions page.
        title3: Counselors
        paragraph3: Our team embraces and fosters a student-run philosophy, promoting student leadership as well as sustainability through having experienced veteran members pass down knowledge to younger students. Reflecting on this philosophy, our high school team members will be the counselors teaching campers and enriching their STEAM education. Just as we were mentored by older team members, we hope to be able to share what we have learned to the younger generation.

        img: /assets/img/summercamp/build-img.png
        info: In the Robot Design and Hardware session, campers will be given the engaging, hands-on experience of designing and building a competitive robot. These robots will be created to complete a FIRST Robotics Competition-style game challenge, which will be revealed at the beginning of the week. In order to ideate and iterate upon their robots’ mechanisms, campers will learn how to use power tools and industry-standard machines. Members of Paly Robotics will be working with campers throughout the process to help them problem-solve, cooperate as a team, and prepare for an exciting tournament at the end of the week.
        title1: Programming
        img1: /assets/img/summercamp/programming.png
        info1: The Programming session seeks to ignite an interest in computer science through its applications in robotics. Using Python, campers will dive deep into the various aspects of robot development through hands-on experience in controlling our team’s competition bots. From driving the robot to utilizing vision pipelines, by the end of the course, all students will have learned new concepts and have the technical know-how to write functional robot code. All levels of experience are encouraged to come, with a unique curriculum for both new programmers and advanced ones.
        title2: Entrepreneurship and Website Design
