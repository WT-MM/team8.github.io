    AboutTheCamp2:
        title2: More than Robots
        paragraph2: When most people think about robotics, they picture computer-controlled machines that are coded to complete certain tasks. While building and programming robots are a big part of what we do, our team provides many more opportunities outside of traditional technical fields. We have different subteams and groups that focus on other non-technical aspects, including art, public relations, and student leadership, to name a few. Through the different sessions offered, campers will be able to experience what makes our team more than just robotics. To learn more about the various sessions, check out the Sessions page.
        title3: Counselors
        paragraph3: Our team embraces and fosters a student-run philosophy, promoting student leadership as well as sustainability through having experienced veteran members pass down knowledge to younger students. Reflecting on this philosophy, our high school team members will be the counselors teaching campers and enriching their STEAM education. Just as we were mentored by older team members, we hope to be able to share what we have learned to the younger generation.

        info: In the Robot Design and Hardware session, campers will be given an engaging experience learning the fundamentals of build and design through lessons and at home hands-on activities. Campers will also be working in groups to come up with solutions to game challenges that we present to them that are similar to the ones we have in FIRST Robotics Competitions. Members of Paly Robotics will be working with campers throughout the process to help them problem-solve, cooperate as a team, and prepare to share their designs.
        title1: Programming
        img1: /assets/img/summercamp/programming.png

Campers will dive deep into the various aspects of software development and will develop the technical know-how to program in the Python programming language, with a focus being placed on its applications in robotics. All levels of experience are encouraged to come, with a unique curriculum for both new programmers and advanced ones.

Most work will be done via Zoom, so each camper will need a free Zoom account to participate in camp.
