    AboutTheTour:
        paragraph: "Next weekend, 60 high school robotics teams from around the world will descend into the heart of Silicon Valley to compete in an epic robotics tournament! This is an official FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) event with teams playing the 2017 game FIRST Steamworks. <br><br>PALY Robotics will be hosting tours of the Silicon Valley Regional (SVR) to introduce parents and students to FRC. Attendees will enjoy a true “FIRST Experience”: walking through the hectic pits where robot repairs are being made, being in the stands watching riveting robot matches, and meeting all the high school students, mentors and volunteers that make it all possible. All along the way student members of our team will curate the experience, guiding you through what FIRST is all about. People of all ages will enjoy the FIRST Experience.<br><br>Tours are completely free, but lunch and transportation to the venue are not provided. Attendees under the age of 14 must be with a parent. After registering, a confirmation email will be sent out with more detailed information on the tours and meeting location. We’re looking forward to seeing you at SVR!"
