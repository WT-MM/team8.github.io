    OpenLabHours: 
        paragraph: The Open Lab Hours program is an exciting opportunity for rising 8th and 9th graders to work with Paly Robotics members at our lab this summer. Through this program, we aim to give students a taste of high school robotics and to inspire them to pursue it in the future. To register, click on the Registration button above.
    WhatWeDo:
         paragraph1: Paly Robotics competes in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), a competitive high school robotics league. In January, FRC teams are given a game challenge and six weeks to brainstorm, design and build a fully functioning robot to play the game. Teams then attend competitions, where they face off against each other in exciting three-on-three matches.
         paragraph2: More general information about FRC can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">here</a> and the game reveal video for the 2019 game, FIRST Deep Space, can be found <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mew6G_og-PI">here</a>.  You can see our 2019 competition robot in action in our <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9dXf6EdstQ">reveal video</a>.
    Robot:
         paragraph: This summer, we are constructing another Deep Space robot that will be optimized for scoring on level one objectives as well as level three climb. Students will have the chance to work with team members on brainstorming ideas, prototyping mechanisms, and building the final robot. Along the way, they will learn about the mechanical design process and the importance of iteration.
    SummerCamp:
         paragraph: The Paly Robotics Summer Camp is a major undertaking for our team, and a lot of work must be done before the camp begins in July. Students will help out with preparing and testing the drivetrains used in the Robot Design and Hardware session, as well as assembling the game field that matches will be played on during the last day of camp.
