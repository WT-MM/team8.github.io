    OpenLabHours: 
        paragraph: The Open Lab Hours program is an exciting opportunity for rising 8th and 9th graders to work with Paly Robotics members at our lab this summer. Through this program, we aim to give students a taste of high school robotics and to inspire them to pursue it in the future. To register, click on the Register button above.
    WhatWeDo:
         paragraph1: Paly Robotics competes in FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC), a competitive high school robotics league. In January, FRC teams are given a game challenge and six weeks to brainstorm, design and build a fully functioning robot to play the game. Teams then attend competitions, where they face off against each other in exciting three-on-three matches.
         paragraph2: More general information about FRC can be found <a href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc">here</a> and the game reveal video for the 2017 game, FIRST Steamworks, can be found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI">here</a>.
    Robot:
         paragraph: This summer, we are constructing a new robot to play FIRST Steamworks and compete in unofficial off-season events in the Fall. Students will have the chance to work with team members to brainstorm ideas, prototype mechanisms, and build a brand new robot. Along the way, they will learn about the mechanical design process and the importance of iteration to produce a good end result.
    SummerCamp:
         paragraph: The Paly Robotics Summer Camp is a major undertaking for our team, and a lot of work must be done before the camp begins in July. Students will help out with preparing and testing the drivetrains used in the Robot Design and Hardware session, as well as assembling the game field that matches will be played on during the last day of camp.
