            Devin joined the team as a Build Team member in 2015, and has been actively involved in robot design, fabrication and assembly ever since.  As a sophomore, he organized supplies for competition and taught the machine safety and training classes during the off-season.  The following year, as Build Captain, Devin led the effort to bring our 2017 robot design to life.  This year, with the responsibility of Team Captain, he plans to continue building the robotics team community and help younger members develop both their technical and leadership skills.

            Maya is a senior who joined Paly Robotics her freshman year as an animator and storyboard artist, 
            eventually becoming the Art Project Manager her sophomore year, before having to take up the mantle of Art 
            Captain when both her predecessors were brutally murdered. When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or 
            Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership, she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH 
            homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's 
            so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten 
            old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.
