            Devin joined the team in 2015 as a freshman. Initially unsure what he wanted to do, he eventually settled on being a 
            part of the Build Team to help manufacture and assemble the robot. Sophomore year, in addition to continuing on the 
            Build Team, Devin organized and readied the tools and supplies to take to competitions as well as kept an eye on safety 
            while the build team was working. Throughout his Junior year, Devin hopes to bring the Build Team closer together and 
            continue to push members to refine and improve their skills.

            Simran Pujji is a junior entering her third year on Team 8. She joined the build subteam in her freshman year and 
            has since held the role of co-summer camp lead and competition manager, but this hasn’t stopped her from working 
            on build projects when she can. When she is not working on robotics, she enjoys reading (and finishing homework). 
            Her favorite part of FIRST Robotics, besides build season, is attending competitions and seeing all of the robots 
            other teams made. She’s looking forward to another great year of FIRST Robotics with Team 8 :)

            Shota Yamamoto is a junior on Team 8 and has been on the team since his sophomore year. He was originally on 
            business team, but realized that his true passion was being more hands on with the robot. While on business, 
            Shota helped find sponsors, and his hard work helped find the team food sponsors for build season. In addition, 
            he was the lead for the Spirit and Stanford Concessions committees. As the year progressed, he found himself 
            helping and organizing scouting and strategy at competitions, cage reorganization in the offseason and the PALY 
            Robotics summer camp. Hoping to make a difference on Team 8, he delved into all work he was given, and is the 
            reason he is our lab manager this year.

            Jennifer Xu is Junior on Team 8 who joined her freshman year. She became the FIRST Project Manager for Business her sophomore year as one of the few members left, and worked with the then business captain(Annalee Soohoo) to build business team into an entrepreneurship award powerhouse. As Business Captain, Jennifer is in charge of projects relating to sponsorships, awards, and outreach. She currently holds the record for most years spent on business(3), and during that time she developed an unhealthy interest in formats, fonts, and presentations.

            Maya is a senior who joined Paly Robotics her freshman year as an animator and storyboard artist, 
            eventually becoming the Art Project Manager her sophomore year, before having to take up the mantle of Art 
            Captain when both her predecessors were brutally murdered. When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or 
            Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership, she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH 
            homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's 
            so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten 
            old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.

            Kendall started out as an eager build team freshman and quickly showed that he was up for any challenge. As the year ended, he stepped into the role of treasurer, a position vital for keeping the team running. In the coming year, Kendall is looking forward to 
            improving the treasury system on the team as well as continuing to be an active member of build team.

            daytrips, or feeding the whole team, Liam does it all! When he’s not planning competitions or helping around the 
            lab, he enjoys juggling and art.

            Eddie joined the build subteam of Paly robotics during his freshman year. As a sophomore, he currently oversees 
            the pit, the place where the robot gets fixed during competition, and makes sure that it is well stocked to 
            fix the robot at anytime. He also makes sure that people are being safe when using machines or power tools. 
            During this coming year, he hopes to make a bigger impact on Team 8 and also make sure that everyone is safe 
            while constructing/fixing the robot.

            team act as one cohesive unit.

            where people can be who they are, enabled by the wisdom and fruits of science and engineering. He is also a 6th degree 
            black belt in AIkido, the martial art of peace. His wife teases him about this, by asking him if he is aware of the 
            definition of the word “martial.”.
