            Devin joined the team as a Build Team member in 2015, and has been actively involved in robot design, fabrication and assembly ever since.  As a sophomore, he organized supplies for competition and taught the machine safety and training classes during the off-season.  The following year, as Build Captain, Devin led the effort to bring our 2017 robot design to life.  This year, with the responsibility of Team Captain, he plans to continue building the robotics team community and help younger members develop both their technical and leadership skills.

            Annalee is a senior who joined Paly Robotics her sophomore year. Last year she was the Business Captain, photography lead, and a Dean’s List Semifinalist. The Assistant Captain works with the Team Captain to cover administrative responsibilities, works with the Project Manager to establish milestones and deadlines, and to works with leadership to ensure team resources are not overextended or being wasted. Annalee is interested in technology, economics, and entrepreneurship. Because of her time on Team 8, she now knows how to operate a laser cutter, and is beginning to learn to code!

            Simran Pujji is a junior entering her third year on Team 8. She joined the build subteam in her freshman year and 
            has since held the role of co-summer camp lead and competition manager, but this hasn’t stopped her from working 
            on build projects when she can. When she is not working on robotics, she enjoys reading (and finishing homework). 
            Her favorite part of FIRST Robotics, besides build season, is attending competitions and seeing all of the robots 
            other teams made. She’s looking forward to another great year of FIRST Robotics with Team 8 :)

            Shota Yamamoto is a junior on Team 8 and has been on the team since his sophomore year. He was originally on 
            business team, but realized that his true passion was being more hands on with the robot. While on business, 
            Shota helped find sponsors, and his hard work helped find the team food sponsors for build season. In addition, 
            he was the lead for the Spirit and Stanford Concessions committees. As the year progressed, he found himself 
            helping and organizing scouting and strategy at competitions, cage reorganization in the offseason and the PALY 
            Robotics summer camp. Hoping to make a difference on Team 8, he delved into all work he was given, and is the 
            reason he is our lab manager this year.

            Jennifer Xu is Junior on Team 8 who joined her freshman year. She became the FIRST Project Manager for Business her sophomore year as one of the few members left, and worked with the then business captain(Annalee Soohoo) to build business team into an entrepreneurship award powerhouse. As Business Captain, Jennifer is in charge of projects relating to sponsorships, awards, and outreach. She currently holds the record for most years spent on business(3), and during that time she developed an unhealthy interest in formats, fonts, and presentations.

            Maya is a senior who joined Paly Robotics her freshman year as an animator and storyboard artist, 
            eventually becoming the Art Project Manager her sophomore year, before having to take up the mantle of Art 
            Captain when both her predecessors were brutally murdered. When not holding serious meetings at Tin Pot or 
            Kirk’s with the Art Team Leadership, she spends her time doing odd-jobs for Paly Theatre and her APUSH 
            homework. And yes, it is very funny that her name is Maya and the Art Team uses Autodesk Maya. In fact, it's 
            so funny that you should definitely make that joke to her face for the 9,999th time, because it hasn’t gotten 
            old by now at all. Ha. Ha. Ha.

            Mr. Kuszmaul grew up in Kansas, went to MIT in the 80’s, worked as a scientist at NASA in the 90’s and took care of 
            his children and learned to be a teacher in the 2000’s.  Since 2012 he has been working to make Paly Robotics a place 
            where people can be who they are, enabled by the wisdom and fruits of science and engineering. He is also a 6th degree 
            black belt in AIkido, the martial art of peace. His wife teases him about this, by asking him if he is aware of the 
            definition of the word “martial.”.
